It also recalls Mutations in places with its Brazilian influences. Product Description. Three years after the critically acclaimed and heart wrenching 'Sea Change' Beck returns with 'Guero', that reunites Beck with classic co-conspirators the Dust Brothers.

AllMusic Review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine + In many ways, Guero is deliberately designed as a classicist Beck album, a return to the sound and aesthetic of his 1996 masterwork, Odelay.

Instead of witty lyricism, experimental genre bends and an upbeat sound, Sea Change offered a calmer, more realistic point of view. It was softer, acoustic, sadder, and very emotional.
